## What it is

This is a version of the classic arcade game: *Frogger*. It was built using Object-Oriented JavaScript Paradigm (ES5 syntax).

Rules are simple, your objective is to reach the water at the other side of the board. If you touch a ladybug you lose and your character goes back to the beginning.

Good Luck & Have fun! :beetle: :leaves: :beetle: :leaves: :beetle: :ocean: :sparkler:
